John Wiley Java Programming Exercise

This exercise should take no longer than one hour.
Feel free to change the supplied code in any way you choose, you may introduce third party libraries 
if you see necessary.
You should produce easy-to-read, functionally correct, tested Java code.

It is important that you provide unit tests for the access control coordinator, but the implementation
of the access control decision makers is not really important for the purposes of this test.

The access control decision makers are threadsafe, and this will run in a multi-threaded environment.
A book is simply represented as a String.

Story
To produce a program that coordinates access control to a book in a library.
The program will grant access to a book if at least one of the two supplied access control decision makers 
returns a true value.

Acceptance Criteria
If the first access control decision maker grants access to the book then access is granted.
If the second access control decision maker grants access to the book then access is granted.
If both access control decision makers grant access then access to the book is granted.
If neither access control decision makers grants access then access is not granted.
If a null value is supplied to the access control coordinator then a checked exception should be thrown.
